    inspiration                          "Peace Builders Soccer League\r\nYALLA's Peace Builders Soccer League (PBSL) is the only one of its kind on the western hemisphere located in the heart of the largest refugee resettlement city in the world. The PBSL brings child survivors of war and immigrant youth from the Middle East, Africa, Asia and Latin America to play together, become teammates and to build community.\r\nYALLA Soccer Club-YSC\r\nYALLA recognizes refugee and immigrant youth who show exceptional talent and dedication to soccer, offering them the opportunity to play together against the region's best soccer clubs. YALLA uses soccer as the incentive to turn their players into mature scholar-athletes. All players in the competitive soccer program earn their scholarship by adhering to YALLA's rigorous academic program.\r\nLeadership Program\r\nYALLA selects players from its competitive program who have exhibited exceptional leadership skills and trains them to become coaches and leaders in its Peace Builders League. Participants receive coaching and leadership training and are paid stipends every season. All coaches are in YALLA's education program volunteer in the community, receive financial literacy training, and receive stipends.\r\nYALLA's Eco-Therapy Program\r\nThroughout the year, YALLA organizes regular outdoor activities such as hiking, biking, kayaking, camping, and various service days, including river clean-ups, invasive plant removal, and planting new trees. Our Eco-Therapy programs focus on building community pride and promoting shared prosperity, while exposing refugee and immigrant youth to the many benefits that nature has to offer.\r\nThree Benefits of YALLA 's Eco-Therapy Program:\r\nThe healing power of nature. Child survivors of war face great adversity. One of the many challenges includes Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. Studies show that nature helps us heal from trauma and violence.\r\nBecoming environmental stewards. The San Diego refugee community has been identified as park poor, with less than three acres of green space for every 1,000 residents. Increasing access to parks, beaches, and other outdoor activities exposes youth to the beauty and biodiversity of the San Diego region. The more children spend in nature, the better caretakers of nature they will become.\r\nCreating community cohesion. Eco-Therapy works to mollify tensions within neighborhoods by promoting a peace-building environment that works to strengthen social capital across the entire community. Our events provide a space for healthy interaction, increased awareness and shared understanding.\r\nEducation Program\r\nYALLA requires academic commitment from all its participants. In order for YALLA youth to play soccer, it is mandatory that they participate in YALLA's education program. To effectively promote education and engage all scholar-athletes, YALLA provides a comprehensive, four-pronged education program that consists of a wide variety of focus areas for its youth. While some of the education components focus on preparing youth for life after high school, other areas concentrate on behavioral assessments and communication strategies resulting in a \"something for everyone\" educational program.\r\n\tTutoring: YALLA scholar-athletes have access to tutoring sessions several times a week. These sessions focus on vocabulary, sentence structure, story writing, reading, homework assistance, and practice math problems.\r\n\tLife Skills: YALLA inspires and motivates young people with its life-skills curriculum, which provides job training (technology), financial-literacy education, and other areas of necessary preparation to help youth succeed in our society of complex systems.\r\n\tInter-Relational Skills: YALLA regularly schedules activities such as music therapy, Capoeira to engage youth in healthy interactions with one another and in everyday life.\r\n\tHigher Education Preparation: Provides opportunities to attend local college and career fairs, linking youth with professionals in careers of interest to them and connecting them to internships and jobs when possible. YALLA also provides college assistance by preparing its youth for college standardized tests and college scholarships.\r\n"
    sustainability_model                 "The partnership YALLA has with the school district opened the door for exciting opportunities for program evaluation to see if YALLA scholar-athletes have made significant strides. During the fall of 2010, YALLA conducted a report where it selected 50 youth from its program and requested that their public school teachers participate in a study that gauges the youths acclimation and behavior in school.\r\nUtilizing a Likert scale based-survey and a Knowledge Attitude and Behavior (KAB) survey as well as open-ended questions, the survey addressed specific questions about YALLA participants classroom behavior, incidents of disciplinary action, and successful acclimation. skills, etc. Another group of 50 randomly selected refugee youth who are not in YALLA participants were selected to serve as a control group. The school and children evaluations from both the YALLA group and the control group were used to determine if the YALLA youth displayed significant signs of behavioral improvement as compared to their refugee peers.\r\nThe main goal of the report was to track individual incidents of violence between refugees and their wider peer population in order to see if YALLA's scholar-athletes healthy interaction has transitioned into the schools. The results of the study confirmed what YALLA volunteers and staff see every day. The report shows YALLA scholar-athletes acclimate significantly better in comparison to their refugee peers demonstrated by the number of reported disciplinary action and violent incidents. \r\nThe study revealed that 65% of those from the control group faced some form of disciplinary action including; suspension, referrals, detention or expulsion etc.  That of the YALLA scholar-athletes is under a 5% incident rate. \r\n\r\nIn the Spring of 2011 YALLA continued its research and focused on four sub categories; (1) school level competency, (2) inter-relational skills, (3) educational life skills,(4) and higher education opportunities. \r\n\r\n1.The school level competency portion placed refugee students in their true grade level, using several different assessments for literacy and math. This is an important step due to the  school system which places refugee students in their grade based on age rather than their competency level. This can sometimes be challenging, for example, when a student in Algebra is struggling with simple arithmetic it has hard to grasp and apply more advanced concepts. Once scholar-athletes are assessed they receive supplemental tutoring in order to catch up to their respective grade level. In one term, 85% of our scholar-athletes jumped up two grade levels in social studies, math and English. \r\n\r\n98% of YALLA senior class were accepted into college. \r\n"
    improvements                         "YALLA is taking steps to improve its ability to better delegate work to and train volunteers and interns. YALLA relies heavily on its dynamic and dedicated volunteer coaches, tutors and interns. In order for YALLA to accomplish its ambitious goals for the future volunteer training must teach increasingly applicable skills and be more effective. YALLA wants to increase the number of trainings for volunteer coaches, field assistants and tutors. YALLA volunteers receive professional training; YALLA's youth coaches receive professional training from the LA 84 foundation and from YALLA's soccer director, tutors are trained by YALLA's education directors and the San Diego Council on Literacy and  field volunteers for t he eco-therapy program by REI and Outdoor Outreach.  Through its social capital and partnerships in the community YALLA must continue to find ways to better train their staff and volunteer to work as efficiently and creatively as possible. \r\nIn the next 2-5 years YALLA plans to open a charter school, which has the ambitious goal to make 100% of its students college bound. Planned to be in the heart of the community, the school will focus on the educational needs of refugee, immigrant and other marginalized youth. The school is planned to open in the fall of 2012 for grades 6-12. The enrollment of the school is anticipated to be around 600 to start and will grow exponentially each year. The school will utilize the Direct Instruction (DI) curriculum. Based on extensive evidence, the DI curriculum has shown to employ the most effective teaching methods for inner city and English learning students. \r\nThe school leadership will create an entire student body that are able and believe that they are college bound. Performing arts will be a fundamental part of the school in an effort for the students to discover an atmosphere where they feel confident enough to learn and speak English. The school will continue the work YALLA has been championing, motivating youth through soccer and eco-therapy outings. Moreover, mechanisms will be put in place to catch students who fall through the cracks. For example, the entire student body will be placed in small groups that will meet bi-weekly with a teacher to ensure they are on track with school, sports and extracurricular activities. Ultimately, the YALLA charter school will serve to promote the desire for academic success by its students while providing a safe haven for expression through art, the natural environment, and performance. \r\nIn order to guarantee its financial sustainability, YALLA will be adopting three main fundraising strategies: an annual fundraiser, individual donor cultivation, grant research & writing, and volunteer involvement. YALLA's first annual fundraiser, took place September 26th, 2010. \r\nThe first annual fundraising gala served not only as a revenue generating vehicle, but also as an effective marketing tool for YALLA San Diego. In addition to the organization's fundraising success, the YALLA Gala also opened the door for important donor relations, including individuals and local businesses, all of whom have cultural ties with the refugee population. YALLA staff is already working to further develop and engage a founders circle of donors. These donors have already established a one-year commitment with the organization's programmatic needs, and they have expressed continued interest. Likewise, fundraising events are instrumental in recruiting dedicated volunteers\r\n"
